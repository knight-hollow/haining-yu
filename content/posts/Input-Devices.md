## Interface Classification and Working Principle
![Haptic Glove](/haining-yu/images/glove.png "Haptic Glove")   
The **Haptic Glove** is a **wearable haptic user interface** designed to provide tactile and kinesthetic feedback during interaction with digital or virtual environments. It belongs to the category of **Tangible User Interfaces (TUI)** and **Multimodal Interaction Systems**, where users engage through multiple senses—sight, sound, and touch.
A typical haptic glove integrates **flex sensors** to detect finger bending, **inertial measurement units (IMUs)** to capture hand motion, and actuators such as vibration motors or force-feedback mechanisms to simulate pressure, texture, or resistance. In immersive systems like **VR** and **AR**, the glove allows users not only to see but also to feel virtual objects—for example, grasping a virtual cup or pushing a virtual door with realistic feedback. This transforms interaction from abstract controller input to direct, embodied manipulation.

## Achievements and Limitations
Haptic gloves have achieved **technical success** in research laboratories and specialized industries such as **surgical training, remote robotics, and rehabilitation therapy**. They significantly improve **immersion and presence** by reintroducing the missing sense of touch in digital experiences.
However, large-scale **commercial success remains limited**. Early prototypes were expensive, heavy, and required complex calibration. Most consumer VR systems (like Oculus or HTC Vive) focused on visual immersion and simple handheld controllers instead. The absence of standardized APIs and compatible software ecosystems also hindered mass adoption. In short, haptic gloves succeeded in demonstrating feasibility and realism but failed to achieve affordability and accessibility for everyday users.

## Future Prospects and Potential for Success
Recent progress in **soft robotics, lightweight materials, and wireless sensing** is revitalizing the potential of haptic gloves. Modern designs, such as **HaptX Glove G1** and **Meta Reality Labs prototypes**, are smaller, more ergonomic, and capable of precise pressure and temperature feedback.
As **metaverse platforms, immersive education, and telepresence applications** expand, the demand for natural, embodied interaction is increasing rapidly. By allowing users to touch and manipulate digital objects as if they were real, haptic gloves may become the cornerstone of **next-generation immersive interfaces**, finally realizing Ivan Sutherland’s vision of the “Ultimate Display.”
