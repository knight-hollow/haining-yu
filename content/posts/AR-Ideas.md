## Ideas
- AR Fitness Coach

The AR Fitness Coach is an augmented reality training assistant designed to guide users during physical exercises.  
Using body tracking and spatial visualization, the system overlays a virtual coach within the user’s real environment.  
It demonstrates correct posture, movement rhythm, and breathing techniques in real time.  
The system is particularly useful for people exercising at home without professional supervision — helping them improve form, avoid injury, and stay motivated.

- AR Navigation View

</div> 

The AR Navigation View aims to improve spatial awareness and safety during navigation in complex environments, such as cities or large campuses.  
Through an AR headset or smartphone camera, virtual directional arrows, distance markers, and contextual points of interest (e.g., restaurants, exits, bus stops) are overlaid directly onto the real-world view.  
Unlike traditional 2D maps, this system merges navigation and reality, reducing cognitive load and allowing users to navigate intuitively.

- AR Learning Enhancer

</div> 

The AR Learning Enhancer is an augmented reality system designed to support knowledge retention and comprehension in education.  
When students study complex subjects (e.g., biology, physics, or history), the system overlays visual explanations — such as 3D molecule models, dynamic equations, or historical reconstructions — directly onto physical textbooks or classroom environments.   
By merging text with interactive visuals, it transforms passive reading into multisensory exploration, encouraging deeper understanding.

## Prototype (Wizard of Oz Simulation)
A Wizard of Oz method was used to simulate the AR experience.
Instead of an actual AR headset, participants wore simple glasses while a “human coach” acted as the virtual assistant.
The facilitator stood nearby and gave real-time feedback on posture and movement, while a phone displayed visual cues such as green outlines for correct form and red highlights for incorrect posture.
During squats and lunges, the “system” (played by the facilitator) verbally corrected users, e.g., “Lower your hips slightly. Keep your knees aligned.”
This simulation allowed participants to experience the intended feedback loop between body motion and AR guidance, without requiring an actual tracking system.

# Evaluation
Two friends of mine participated in this simulation.
Both reported that the presence of a “virtual” coach made them more aware of their body alignment and helped sustain motivation.
They appreciated the immediate visual correction and real-time encouragement, noting it felt more interactive than simply watching a video tutorial.

However, they also pointed out potential privacy concerns and visual distraction when the coach’s holographic model overlapped with background clutter.  
Future iterations could improve usability by incorporating adaptive transparency, eye-gaze–based UI, and voice-only coaching mode for minimal distraction.

Overall, participants viewed the AR Fitness Coach as a promising concept for personalized and safe home workouts.
